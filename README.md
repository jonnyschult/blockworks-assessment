# Blockworks Assessment

This is a clone of [hulu.com](https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F). Time constraints left this project unfinished for the assessment. I privileged development flow and best practices over finished product given the instructions. As such, I used a contemporary styling library, MUI, and a popular JS framework, React.

## Start

`yarn start`

## Deps

This app was created using React and MUI version 5.
